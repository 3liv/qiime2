Contributing to QIIME 2
-----------------------

QIIME 2 is an open-source project, and we are very interested in contributions from the community. We're in early development status right now, so you should get in touch through the [QIIME 2 issue tracker](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/issues) if you'd like to get involved. This guide will be expanded as we transition to our alpha version of QIIME 2 in the summer of 2016.
